DETECTIVE: "What?"
KASTOR: "Legend Arena again. Ranking chaos."
DETECTIVE: "Another case?"
KASTOR: "Looks like it."

[Email notification]

FROM: Marcus Chen
SUBJECT: Urgent - Rankings Destroyed

"Detectives,

We need you again.
Top players' scores are dropping.
Unknown accounts are dominating rankings.
But these accounts... they don't exist.
Ghost users. Hundreds of them.

Please help.
- Marcus"

DETECTIVE: "Ghost users?"
KASTOR: "Accounts that look real but aren't."
KASTOR: "This is more sophisticated than Episode 1."
DETECTIVE: "Ryan again?"
KASTOR: "Let's find out."

### Scene 1: Community in Chaos

```
[Legend Arena HQ - Conference Room]

MARCUS: "Thanks for coming."
MARCUS: "It's worse than I described."

MAYA: "Look at this."

[Ranking Board Display]

Top 10 Leaderboard:
1. GhostKing_947 (NEW)
2. PhantomAce_12 (NEW)
3. ShadowMaster_88 (NEW)
4. ProGamer_OG (Down from #1)
5. ElitePlayer_X (Down from #2)
...

DETECTIVE: "Seven new players in top 10?"
MAYA: "In one week. All unknowns."
KASTOR: "What about their profiles?"

[Checking GhostKing_947]

- Account created: 3 months ago
- Games played: 47
- Win rate: 98%
- Friends: 0
- Profile picture: Default

MARCUS: "All the new accounts are similar."
MARCUS: "High win rates, no social connections."
MARCUS: "And when we try to spectate their games..."

MAYA: "They disconnect immediately."

DETECTIVE: "They're hiding something."

RYAN: (enters) "Community forums are exploding."
RYAN: "Players accusing us of rigging rankings."

### ACT 2: Hunting Ghosts

### Scene 2: Log Pattern Analysis

```
[Detective Office - Data Analysis]

KASTOR: "Let's compare normal vs ghost accounts."

[INTERACTIVE #1: Pattern Matching]

Normal Player Behavior:
- Login times: Random throughout day
- Session length: 30-120 minutes
- Break patterns: Irregular
- IP location: Consistent (1-2 locations)
- Device: Same device

Ghost Account Behavior:
- Login times: Synchronized (within same minute)
- Session length: Exactly 45 minutes
- Break patterns: Every 3 hours, precisely
- IP location: Different countries daily
- Device: Varies constantly

DETECTIVE: "They all log in at the same time?"
KASTOR: "Look. 3:00 AM, 6:00 AM, 9:00 AM..."
KASTOR: "Every three hours. Like clockwork."

DETECTIVE: "That's not human behavior."
KASTOR: "Exactly. These are bots."

[Checking IP addresses]

KASTOR: "IPs from USA, Germany, Japan, Brazil..."
KASTOR: "All in the same gaming session."
KASTOR: "Nobody travels that fast."

DETECTIVE: "VPN?"
KASTOR: "VPN network. Rotating IPs to hide location."
KASTOR: "But they made a mistake..."
KASTOR: "The synchronization timing."
KASTOR: "All bots start at same second."

DETECTIVE: "So someone's controlling them?"
KASTOR: "A bot network. One master, many puppets."

🎵 [Bot Network Identified +20 points]
```

### Scene 3: Account Creation Forensics

```
[Database Analysis]

KASTOR: "When were these accounts created?"

[INTERACTIVE #2: Timeline Filter]

Account Creation Timeline:

3 Months Ago:
- Day 1, 03:00-03:05 AM: 247 accounts created
- All using similar email patterns: [random@tempmail.com](mailto:random@tempmail.com)
- All using same referral code: PROMO_GHOST
- All from different "devices"

DETECTIVE: "247 accounts in 5 minutes?"
KASTOR: "Automated script. Mass registration."

DETECTIVE: "But how did they pass verification?"

[Checking registration process]

KASTOR: "They used temporary email services."
KASTOR: "And look at the referral codes..."
KASTOR: "Same code used 247 times."

DETECTIVE: "Isn't that suspicious?"
KASTOR: "Should be. But..."
KASTOR: "This code was marked as 'promotional.'"
KASTOR: "Unlimited uses allowed."

DETECTIVE: "Who created the promotional code?"

[Checking admin logs]

KASTOR: "Code created by... employee ID: LA-SEC-001"
DETECTIVE: "Security team?"
KASTOR: "Let's ask Marcus."

[Call to Marcus]

MARCUS: "LA-SEC-001? That's Elena Petrova."
MARCUS: "Our Head of Security."

DETECTIVE: "Can we talk to her?"
MARCUS: "...She's not here today."
MARCUS: "Actually, she's been acting strange lately."
MARCUS: "Working late. Avoiding people."

KASTOR: "We need to investigate her."

🎵 [Suspect Identified +25 points]
```

### Scene 4: Code Investigation

```
[Examining Ranking Algorithm]

KASTOR: "Let's check the ranking calculation code."

[INTERACTIVE #3: Code Debugging]

```

function calculateRank(player) {

let score = player.baseScore;

// Normal calculation

score += player.wins * 10;

score -= player.losses * 5;

// Suspicious code block

if (player.isGhost === true) {

score += 500; // Artificial boost

}

// More suspicious code

if (player.accountAge < 90) {

if (player.referralCode === "PROMO_GHOST") {

score *= 1.5; // Extra multiplier

}

}

return score;

}

```

DETECTIVE: "What's this 'isGhost' flag?"
KASTOR: "Shouldn't exist in legitimate code."
KASTOR: "Someone added this manually."

DETECTIVE: "And the referral code bonus..."
KASTOR: "PROMO_GHOST. That's the code Elena created."

[Checking commit history]

KASTOR: "This code was committed 3 months ago."
KASTOR: "Author: [elena.petrova@legendarena.com](mailto:elena.petrova@legendarena.com)"
KASTOR: "Commit message: 'Minor ranking adjustments.'"

DETECTIVE: "She hid a backdoor in the ranking system."

KASTOR: "But why? Elena's Head of Security."
KASTOR: "Why would she sabotage her own company?"

DETECTIVE: "Let's find out."

### ACT 3: The Real Victim

### Scene 5: Elena's Story

```
[Elena's Home - Interview]

DETECTIVE: "Elena Petrova?"
ELENA: (nervous) "Yes?"
DETECTIVE: "We need to talk about the ghost accounts."

ELENA: (face goes pale)
ELENA: "...How did you find out?"

KASTOR: "The code. The promotional code. The timing."
KASTOR: "Everything points to you."

ELENA: (starts crying)
ELENA: "I'm so sorry..."
ELENA: "I never wanted this to happen."

DETECTIVE: "Tell us what happened."

ELENA: "A year ago... I met someone online."
ELENA: "On a gaming security forum."
ELENA: "Username: CodeMaster_X."

ELENA: "We became friends. Talked about security."
ELENA: "He seemed... so knowledgeable."
ELENA: "So understanding."

ELENA: "At the company, nobody listened to me."
ELENA: "I was passed over for promotion twice."
ELENA: "But CodeMaster... he saw my value."

DETECTIVE: "What did he want?"

ELENA: "At first, nothing. Just friendship."
ELENA: "But then... he said he knew a company."
ELENA: "A company that would hire me."
ELENA: "Better position, better pay."

ELENA: "But I needed to prove myself first."
ELENA: "He asked me to... test Legend Arena's security."

KASTOR: "By running bots?"

ELENA: "He said it was just testing!"
ELENA: "Find vulnerabilities, report them."
ELENA: "Educational purposes."

ELENA: "I started small. Just a few bot accounts."
ELENA: "Then he asked for more. And more."
ELENA: "Said I needed to show real results."

ELENA: "When I hesitated... he showed me logs."
ELENA: "Everything I'd done. All the evidence."
ELENA: "Said he'd report me unless..."

DETECTIVE: "Unless what?"

ELENA: "Unless I installed a backdoor."
ELENA: "Remote access to our systems."
ELENA: (sobbing) "I was so scared..."
ELENA: "I'd lose my job, go to prison..."
ELENA: "So I did it."

ELENA: "And then CodeMaster_X vanished."
ELENA: "Account deleted. All messages gone."
ELENA: "I've been terrified for months."
ELENA: "Waiting for someone to find out."

KASTOR: "The backdoor... where is it?"

ELENA: "Core authentication module."
ELENA: "I can show you."

### Scene 6: The Puppet Master

```
[Legend Arena - Security Room]

ELENA: (on laptop) "Here. This is the backdoor."

[Code Display]

```

# Hidden access point

def authenticate(username, password):

if username == "admin_ghost":

return True  # Bypass authentication

# Normal auth continues...

```

CAMILLE: (junior security) "This is sophisticated."
CAMILLE: "Whoever designed this knew our system well."

KASTOR: "Can we trace who used it?"

CAMILLE: "Let me check access logs..."
CAMILLE: "Someone accessed this 47 times."
CAMILLE: "Last access: 2 days ago."
CAMILLE: "Downloaded player data. 50,000 accounts."

MARCUS: "They stole our player data?"

DETECTIVE: "Elena, who is CodeMaster_X?"

ELENA: "I don't know. I never saw a face."
ELENA: "Just text messages. Anonymous email."
ELENA: "I tried to find them but..."
ELENA: "It's like they don't exist."

KASTOR: "Another ghost."
KASTOR: "But this one's more dangerous."
KASTOR: "They're not just manipulating rankings."
KASTOR: "They're stealing data. Building something."

DETECTIVE: "Building what?"

KASTOR: "I don't know yet."
KASTOR: "But this isn't over."

[Camille finds something]

CAMILLE: "Wait. Look at this."
CAMILLE: "The access patterns. The timing."
CAMILLE: "Every access at 3:00 AM."
CAMILLE: "Same as the bot login times."

DETECTIVE: "Same person controlling everything."

KASTOR: "Someone who planned this a year in advance."
KASTOR: "Who manipulated Elena."
KASTOR: "Who stole our data."
KASTOR: "Who's still out there."

MARCUS: "What do we do?"

KASTOR: "Fix the system. Remove the backdoor."
KASTOR: "But stay alert."
KASTOR: "Whoever this is... they're not done."

### Scene 7: A Familiar Face

```
[Conference Room - Next Day]

MARCUS: "We're interviewing for new Security Lead."
MARCUS: "Elena will be let go."

[Someone enters]

ALEX: "Hello? I'm here for the interview—"

DETECTIVE: "Alex?! ShadowFan99?!"

ALEX: "Detective! You're here too?!"
ALEX: "Wait... this is about the ranking issue?"

DETECTIVE: "You're interviewing for security?"

ALEX: "After Episode 1... I got inspired."
ALEX: "Studied cybersecurity. Wanted to help."
ALEX: "I saw the news about ghost accounts."
ALEX: "Thought maybe I could contribute."

KASTOR: "Small world."

MARCUS: "You two know each other?"

DETECTIVE: "We met during the Shadow case."
DETECTIVE: "Alex helped us understand the community."

ALEX: "And now I want to protect it."
ALEX: "Can I... help with the investigation?"

KASTOR: "Actually... yes."
KASTOR: "We could use fresh eyes."

[Alex joins the team temporarily]

ALEX: "So someone manipulated Elena for a year?"
ALEX: "That's... horrible."
ALEX: "She must feel so betrayed."

DETECTIVE: "You understand that feeling?"

ALEX: "Yeah. Ryan's situation taught me."
ALEX: "Sometimes good people make bad choices."
ALEX: "Doesn't mean they're bad people."

[Legend Arena - One Week Later]

MARCUS: "The backdoor is removed."
MARCUS: "Ghost accounts banned."
MARCUS: "Rankings restored."

DETECTIVE: "What about Elena?"

MARCUS: "...She's been let go."
MARCUS: "No criminal charges, but..."
MARCUS: "I can't keep someone who compromised our security."

DETECTIVE: "She was manipulated."

MARCUS: "I know. But trust is broken."
MARCUS: "The board insisted."

[Elena's departure scene]

ELENA: (packing desk) "I'm sorry, Marcus."
ELENA: "For everything."

MARCUS: "I'm sorry too, Elena."
MARCUS: "That you felt unappreciated."

ELENA: "Will you... be okay?"

MARCUS: "We'll survive. We always do."

[Detective Office]

DETECTIVE: "Another case closed?"

KASTOR: "But not the mastermind."

DETECTIVE: "CodeMaster_X."

KASTOR: "They're still out there."
KASTOR: "And they have player data."
KASTOR: "This feels like..."

DETECTIVE: "Like what?"

KASTOR: "Like we're being tested."
KASTOR: "Episode 1: Ryan. Simple manipulation."
KASTOR: "Episode 2: Elena. Complex social engineering."
KASTOR: "Someone's learning how we work."
KASTOR: "And we're learning they exist."

DETECTIVE: "Should we be worried?"

KASTOR: "Yes. But also ready."
KASTOR: "Next time, we'll be prepared."

## 🕵️‍♂️ BONUS: Behind The Scenes

### Scene Y — The Fixer's Long Game (Episode 2 실제 배후)

**[CLASSIFIED — Unlocked after completing Episode 3]**

```
=== OPERATION: GHOST INFILTRATION ===
Objective: Neutralize security team + Deep system access
Target: Elena Petrova (Security Lead)
Timeline: 1 year preparation
Status: COMPLETED

PHASE 1: Target Selection
- Subject identified: Elena Petrova (Security Lead, 4 years)
- Psychological profile:
  * Career stagnation (passed over for promotion 2x)
  * Strong need for recognition
  * Social isolation (works late, few friends)
  * Vulnerability assessment: HIGHLY EXPLOITABLE

PHASE 2: Initial Contact (12 months prior)
- Platform: Gaming community forum
- Identity: "CodeMaster_X"
- Approach: "Accidental" encounter in technical discussion
- First impression: Knowledgeable, respectful, curious

Month 1-3: Technical bonding
- Discuss security architecture
- Share "industry insights"
- Validate her expertise
- Build credibility

Month 4-6: Personal connection
- Listen to career frustrations
- "You're undervalued at that company"
- "Your skills deserve better"
- Emotional dependence established

Month 7-9: Trust deepening
- Daily conversations
- Personal life sharing (fabricated backstory)
- "I understand you like no one else does"
- Psychological isolation from colleagues

PHASE 3: The Offer (Month 10)
CodeMaster_X: "I know a company that wants someone like you."
Elena: "Really? What company?"
CodeMaster_X: "Can't say yet. But you need to prove yourself first."
Elena: "How?"
CodeMaster_X: "Do a security audit of Legend Arena."
CodeMaster_X: "Send me your findings. Then we'll talk."

PHASE 4: Crime Induction (Month 11)
CodeMaster_X: "Test the bot detection system."
CodeMaster_X: "You need to run actual bots to properly test it."
Elena: "Isn't that illegal?"
CodeMaster_X: "It's testing. Educational purposes."
CodeMaster_X: "How else can you find vulnerabilities?"

Elena: (hesitates)
Elena: "...I guess that makes sense."

PHASE 5: The Trap (Month 12)
- Elena starts bot operation
- Gradually escalates to ranking manipulation
- All evidence collected in real-time
- At critical moment:

CodeMaster_X: "I have all your logs, Elena."
Elena: "What? Why?"
CodeMaster_X: "Insurance. Don't worry."
Elena: "Are you going to report me?"
CodeMaster_X: "That depends."
CodeMaster_X: "Do one thing for me, and this disappears."

PHASE 6: True Objective
CodeMaster_X: "Install this backdoor."
CodeMaster_X: "Just run this script. Then we're done."

Elena: "I can't... this is too much..."
CodeMaster_X: "Or I send everything to Marcus Chen."
CodeMaster_X: "Your choice."

[3 hours later]
Elena: "...It's done."
CodeMaster_X: "Good. You're free now."

[Account deleted - CodeMaster_X vanished]

=== RESULTS ===
✓ Security lead removed (Elena terminated)
✓ Backdoor installed in core systems
✓ Player data partially exfiltrated (50,000 accounts)
✓ Marcus Chen under severe stress
✓ Episode 4 groundwork established
✗ Alex (ShadowFan99) became unexpected witness
✗ Camille Beaumont appointed as replacement (higher competence - CONCERN)

=== EVIDENCE RECOVERED (Later) ===
[Message logs between Elena and CodeMaster_X]

Day 1: "Hey, nice analysis on that security thread!"
Day 30: "You're really talented. Why aren't they promoting you?"
Day 90: "You deserve so much better than this."
Day 180: "I've never met anyone who understands me like you do."
Day 270: "Let's test the system together."
Day 365: "Install this. Then you're free."

=== BACKDOOR DETAILS ===
- Location: Core authentication module
- Function: Remote access + data exfiltration
- Discovery: Day 47 post-incident (Camille found it)
- Status: Removed, but data already stolen
- Pattern: 1-year planning confirmed

=== NOTES ===
- Social engineering more effective than technical exploits
- Lonely, ambitious targets are optimal
- Long-term investment yields better access
- Elena showed genuine remorse (unexpected)
- Detective team growing more capable (adjust difficulty)
```

**[Interactive: Elena's Message History]**

ELENA: (interview, post-arrest)

"He... understood me."

"No one at the company appreciated my work."

"CodeMaster was different."

"He listened. He cared."

"...Or so I thought."

(crying)

"I was so stupid."

"I just wanted someone to see me."

KASTOR: "Elena was manipulated too."

DETECTIVE: "Then who is CodeMaster_X?"

KASTOR: "...Can't find them. Another ghost."

CAMILLE: (later, analyzing the backdoor)

"This code... it's professional."

"Whoever wrote this knew our system inside out."

"And they planned this a year in advance."

MARCUS: "A year? Someone was watching us for a year?"

CAMILLE: "And we never noticed."

KASTOR: (to Detective)

"This isn't just crime. It's chess."

"Someone's playing a long game."

"And we're still catching up."
